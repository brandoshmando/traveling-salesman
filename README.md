Traveling Salesman
==================
Allows a user to enter an origin and up to nine waypoints. On submit, this info is sent using the google directions API
to calculate the most efficient route based on the addresses entered.

Purpose
-------
I started this project because it was a good way for me to practice using javascript and jQuery 
in conjunction with a form. I also wanted to familiarize myself with the Google Maps/Directions API and using API's in general.
